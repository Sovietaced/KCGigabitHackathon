KCGigabitHackathon
==================

I was a sponsored hacker for the Kansas City Gigabic Hackathon, also known as "Hacking the Gigabit City". I joined a team that operated SportsPhotos.com
and created a java application that takes high res picture from the camera to the cloud in about 7 seconds. The application reads to file changes 
on a directory and concurrently FTPs the images to the SportsPhotos.com web server. Then it executes a get request which begins post processing, watermarking,
etc. From the click of the button to the live streaming homepage these high res images were able to be piped at unreal speeds using google fiber.

It was an awesome event that really opened my eyes to the startup culture that is growing in KC.
